# What is it?

Blank loves learning aims to be a way for companies to track employee learning progress, I think these are called LMS (Learning Management Systems)

BLL doesn't aim to host any content, just link to content external to it 

Anyone can submit a learning opportunity (link to training, video, a document) and once submitted anyone can comment and rate it 

Companies can mark an opportunity as endorsed, meaning that they encourage employees to take it and that they will reimburse employees for it

Another higher level feature is the ability to organize groups to go through a course/book together
